# Open-e-TrustEx
Open e-TrustEx is a platform offered by the Directorate-General for Informatics of the European Commission to Public Administrations at European, national and regional level to set up secure exchange of natively digital documents from system to system via standardized interfaces. Open e-TrustEx provides a set of generic web services, which Public Administrations can use to connect heterogeneous applications, removing the need for complex point-to-point connections.
